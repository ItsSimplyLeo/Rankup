# Rankup
Simple Rankup system for Spigot in the works. Right now it is in a very basic state, will update periodically.

## Default Configuration
```yaml
ranks:
default:
price: 0 # Does not matter on the first rank, as it's what you start with.
permissions:
- 'essentials.kit.default'
beta:
price: 10000
permissions:
- 'essentials.kit.beta'
charlie:
price: 25000
permissions:
